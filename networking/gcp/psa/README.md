Google and third parties (together known as service producers) can offer services that are hosted in a VPC network. Private services access lets you reach the internal IP addresses of these Google and third-party services by using private connections. This is useful if you want your VM instances in your VPC network to use internal IP addresses instead of external IP addresses.
