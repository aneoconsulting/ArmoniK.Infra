# Introduction

Hereafter we describe the instructions to install Kubernetes on an onpremise cluster. We present two examples of
Kubernetes on Linux machines:

* [K3s Lightweight Kubernetes](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/)
* [Kubeadm (K8s)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/)

> **_NOTE:_** A developer or tester can deploy a small cluster in AWS. This is useful for the development and testing only!

# K3s

The instructions to install K3s on a cluster are presented in [K3s on a cluster](k3s-cluster/README.md)

# Kubeadm

The instructions to install kubeadm on a cluster are presented in [Kubeadm on a cluster](kubeadm-cluster/README.md)
