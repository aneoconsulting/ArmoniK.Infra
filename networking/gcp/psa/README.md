# GCP Private Service Access

Google and third parties (together known as service producers) can offer services that are hosted in a VPC network. Private
services access (PSA) lets you reach the internal IP addresses of these Google and third-party services by using private
connections. This is useful if you want your VM instances in your VPC network to use internal IP addresses instead of
external IP addresses. The official documentation
for [Private service access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-services-access).
