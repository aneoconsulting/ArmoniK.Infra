Memorystore for Redis provides a fully-managed service that is powered by the Redis in-memory data store to build application caches that provide sub-millisecond data access.

This module creates a Memorystore with these possibilities :

Configure the persistence config for the memorystore
Configure the maintainance policy for the memorystore

This module must be used with these constraints:

Use the same availability zone and region to all the repositories.
