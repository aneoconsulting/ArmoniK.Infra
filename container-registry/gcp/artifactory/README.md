Artifact Registry provides a single location for storing and managing your packages and Docker container images.

This module creates an artifact registry of docker images with these possibilities :

Enable or disable mutability
Add some rights for a list of users
<!-- Enable or disable the force delete -->
<!-- Choose the encryption type -->
<!-- Set a lifecycle policy -->

This module must be used with these constraints:

Use the same availability zone to all the repositories
Give the image name and the tag of all the images
