# GCP Memorystore

Google Memorystore for Redis provides a fully-managed service that is powered by the Redis in-memory data store to build
application caches that provide sub-millisecond data access.

This module creates a Memorystore with these possibilities :

* Configure the persistence for the Memorystore.
* Configure the maintenance policy for the Memorystore.
* The Transit encryption is set to true by default.
