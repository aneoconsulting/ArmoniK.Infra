# Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage
for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing
large data objects to users via direct download.

This module creates a Google Cloud Storage with these possibilities :

* Add ACLs on the newly created cloud storage.
* Bind IAM Roles to the newly created cloud storage.
