Cloud Key Management Service allows you to create, import, and manage cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations in a single centralized cloud service. You can use these keys and perform these operations by using Cloud KMS directly, by using Cloud HSM or Cloud External Key Manager, or by using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) integrations within other Google Cloud services.

This module create a crypto key and a key ring with these possibilities :

Configure the IAM policy for the newly created crypto key.
Configure the IAM policy for the newly created key ring.
Create a KMS key import job.
Create a ciphertext encryption on a key.
